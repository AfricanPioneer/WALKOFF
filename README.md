# WALKOFF
An active cyber defense development framework enabling orchestration capabilities to be written once and deployed across WALKOFF-enabled orchestration tools.  

## Branches
1. Master - Main branch for WALKOFF version 2 
2. Walkoff-2 - Experimental branch for WALKOFF version 2
3. Walkoff-Experimental - WALKOFF version 1  *No longer under development*

Note: WALKOFF is in alpha and is undergoing changes daily. We are currently "sprinting" towards our first stable version at which point we will move daily development to the walkoff-2 branch and have a periodic update of the master stable branch.
